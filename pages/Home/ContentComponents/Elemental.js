                <p>
                    Arised from the fire of a volcano, she embodies fury and anger. She gave
                    shelter to those who worshiped as Goddess and scorching death to her detractors. She
                    represents power.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As the fire she has not any side. You can catch her attention only in special events in which you must venerate the Mother of Fire. 
                </p>

                </p>
                <p>

                <h3>Liqüo</h3>
                <p>
                    He is the largest of all the dragons that have ever existed. He made seas and
                    oceans his abode where he remains oblivious to what happens in the outside world. He
                    maintains balance and his element is water.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lord of the Depths has only one side, his own… He’s willing to recreate the world at its own twisted image and sink everything into the darkness of its waters.
                </p>
                <p>
